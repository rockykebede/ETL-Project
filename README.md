# ETL-Project
Data analysis and management requires data integration. These data may come in different formats and sources such as csv files, json, files, or html tables. Integration of various datasets is a key for data analysis. In other words, identifying the dataset, extracting and reading the data, cleaning and structuring it in the desired format, and loading the clean data into a database for storage is imperative for analysis and management. Integrating this which is an important part of working with data. For this ETL project we will use United Census Bureau website, which contains U.S. annual retail trade data in terms of total sales, sales taxes, Inventories and purchases.
